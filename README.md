# Quality Measures Framework

This project is about the use of quality measures in data mining. Typically, we use several measures to determine the quality of a data mining model.
In particular, this framework is oriented towards measures for pattern mining for descriptive induction. With this project, I try to
simplify the process of getting the quality measures of a descriptive pattern mining process, avoiding errors of re-writting these measures on each project we made.

The measures are based on a contingency table or confusion matrix. So they are statistical-based measures. This framework collects all .java files in the "qualitymeasures" package. With these classes, we can call the method "getValue" of each class with a simple for loop to the quality value.

Of course, any suggestion or correction is welcome. If you have any doubt, please, contact me.

I hope you enjoy using it!
